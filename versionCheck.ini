tag="v1.3.0"
notes="New features:| - Added advanced affinity management| - Removed instance freezing| - If you have bypass wall enabled and lock a previewing instance on the wall, you'll automatically join it when it loads (I'll probably make this a separate setting)| - Added support for SleepBackground v3 (included in macro download). This will mainly help people with low-end graphics cards| - Improved tray options| - Added support for F1 toggling on the wall. Set "f1" to "true" at the bottom of your standardoptions.txt and the macro will handle the rest :)||Bug fixes / minor improvements:| - Fixed instances not going wide on exit world| - Lots of minor improvements to the config GUI| - Added support for more varied Java installations| - Improved logging for various scripts, will help debugging users' issues| - Macro presses f3 when you exit a world removing ghost pie chart on the next preview| - Fixed a ready sound being too short so it wouldn't be audible| - Removed automatic "re-reset" if a reset isn't successfully validated within 25 seconds. Instead, you can reset instances that haven't been validated after 3 seconds."
