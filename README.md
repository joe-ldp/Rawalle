# Rawalle is gone ðŸ¦€

## Use [Julti](https://github.com/DuncanRuns/Julti) instead, it's awesome!

## Credit

- [Specnr](https://github.com/Specnr) for creating the original public Wall macro which I learned a lot from
- [Algorythm](https://github.com/Algorythm-pro) for backseating my code a bunch
- The collaborators listed on GitHub for minor enhancements (most of these are actually carried over from Specnr's macro and their code isn't here anymore lol)
- [jojoe77777](https://github.com/jojoe77777) for making the original Wall macro (and general contribution to macros/tech)
- Everyone I can't list who contributed ideas
- Everyone who tried early/buggy versions and reported issues (Especially poni and priffin!)
- Everyone who reported issues and been patient while I try to debug them
